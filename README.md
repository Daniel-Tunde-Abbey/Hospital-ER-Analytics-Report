# Hospital-ER-Analytics-Report (2021-2023)


## Overview 
This repository contains a **Power BI dashboard** that provides a comprehensive analysis of **Emergency Room (ER) patient data** from **2021 to 2023**. The dashboard was inspired by the work of **Chiamaka Igwe** and aims to offer **valuable insights into ER performance, patient demographics, admission rates, and referral trends**.  

By analyzing key ER metrics, this project helps **healthcare professionals and administrators** make **data-driven decisions** to improve hospital efficiency, patient experience, and resource allocation.  


## Problem Statement  
Emergency Rooms are **critical** in providing immediate medical care. However, challenges such as **high patient influx, long wait times, inefficient referrals, and uneven resource distribution** can impact healthcare delivery. This dashboard was created to **uncover trends, identify bottlenecks, and provide recommendations** to enhance ER efficiency and **optimize patient management strategies**.  


## Objectives 
The primary goals of this project are to:  
1. Analyze ER patient trends over time.
2. Measure patient admission rates and identify seasonal variations.
3. Break down patients by **gender, race, age group, and referral department**.
4. Evaluate average wait times and patient satisfaction levels.
5. Identify which departments receive the most referrals from the ER.
6. Recommend actionable insights to optimize ER operations.  


## Data & Methodology
### Data Source
The dataset was sourced from **hospital records** containing patient visit details from **2021 to 2023**. The data includes:  
- **Patient demographics** (age, gender, race)  
- **Admission status** (admitted vs. not admitted)  
- **ER wait times** (in minutes)  
- **Satisfaction scores** (on a scale of 1 to 10)  
- **Department referrals** (e.g., cardiology, neurology, physiotherapy)  
- **Quarterly trends**  


### Data Cleaning & Processing  
The dataset was cleaned and transformed using **Microsoft Excel** before being loaded into **Power BI** for visualization. Key steps included:  
- Handling **missing values**  
- Standardizing **data formats**  
- Filtering **outliers**  
- Creating **calculated columns** for better analysis  


### Visualization & Analysis 
The cleaned dataset was then imported into **Power BI**, where interactive visuals were created, including:  
- **KPI Metrics** (Total patients, admission rates, average wait time, satisfaction scores)  
- **Line charts** (showing monthly patient trends)  
- **Bar charts** (for department referrals and race distribution)  
- **Pie chart** (gender distribution)  
- **Heatmaps & Scatter plots** (analyzing ER traffic patterns)  


## Key Insights
1. The ER attended to **1,995** patients over three years.
2. The **admission rate stood at 49.72%**, suggesting nearly half of ER visits required hospitalization.
3. The **average wait time was 39.98 minutes**, which could be further optimized.
4. **Patient satisfaction** averaged **6.49/10**, indicating room for improvement in service delivery.
5. **Summer months (June‚ÄìAugust) recorded the highest patient influx**, requiring better resource planning.
6. **Quarter 3 (Q3) had the highest patient volume (560),** while Q4 had the least (440).
7. **General Practice received the most ER referrals (314),** followed by **Cardiology (297) and Neurology (287).**
8. **The largest patient group was 60+ years (485),** highlighting the need for geriatric care planning.  


## Recommendations 
1. Since **patient visits peak during Q3 and summer months**, hospitals should consider **scaling up staff and resources** during these periods.  
2. The **39.98-minute average wait time** could be reduced by **streamlining triage processes** and increasing ER efficiency.  
3. With an **average satisfaction score of 6.49**, hospitals should **gather feedback on service delays, communication gaps, and waiting conditions** to enhance patient experience.
4. Since **General Practice and Cardiology received the most referrals**, hospitals should **improve referral coordination** to ensure faster patient transitions.
5. With a **high proportion of elderly patients (60+ years)**, the ER should be **better equipped for geriatric emergencies**.  


## Conclusion 
This **Hospital ER Analytics Dashboard** provides actionable insights that can **drive operational efficiency, improve patient care, and optimize hospital resource management**. By leveraging data analytics, healthcare facilities can **make informed decisions, reduce wait times, and enhance overall service delivery**.
